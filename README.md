# Leadership Response to Change Diagnostic Tool

This interactive HTML tool helps senior leaders reflect on their response to organisational change, using the Bridges Trapeze Model (2005) as a foundation. It guides users through three phases of transition — Endings, Neutral Zone, and New Beginnings — and provides strategic interpretation based on their scores.

## 🔍 Purpose

Designed for coaching, facilitation, and leadership development, this tool supports:
- Strategic self-reflection during change initiatives
- Sponsor-facing diagnostics for programme impact
- Group facilitation and coaching conversations

## 🧠 Based On

This tool is inspired by William Bridges’ Trapeze Model (2005), adapted for strategic leadership contexts. All interpretations and framing are original and designed by **Davies Group** for coaching and facilitation purposes.

## 🛠️ How It Works

- Users rate 15 statements across three sections (Endings, Neutral Zone, New Beginnings)
- Scores are auto-calculated and interpreted with strategic narratives
- No data is stored or transmitted — all processing is local
